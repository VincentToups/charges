        <h1>Charges</h1>
        <p>This is a hot-seat, two player strategy game.</p>
        <p>Each player controls 16 pieces, each with a positive or negative charge.</p>
        <p>Positive charges repel the seven pucks, negative charges attract them. Player's score points by pushing or pulling pucks off of the screen on their opponent's side. The winner is the one with the most points.</p>
        <p>Click near a piece on your turn to move it within its move range. `c` cancels a move.</p>
        <p>After each move the charges will be moved forward in time. Red lines indicate future motion.</p>
